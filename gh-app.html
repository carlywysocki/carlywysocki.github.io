		<h1>Guelph-Humber App</h1>
		
		<p>A design I did while still a student for a hypothetical mobile app for students at Guelph-Humber. The app was designed as a way for students to get the latest school news, and keep track of their classes and events going on in the school. They could connect with other students (Classmates), and it would display when they were attending an event or class you were going to or interested in. There was also a section called Study Hall, that was a small forum where students could ask questions or have discussions about different areas of study and events happening in the school.</p>
